# NotePad Studio

WHAT IS NOTEPAD STUDIO?
-----------------------

Notepad Studio is a new free open-source full-featured notepad alternative. It will be similar to an IDE, except for text files. It aims to be your all-in-one tool for every note taking need while always being compatible with any other notepad editor. Notepad Studio will focus on productivity, aiming on keeping you more productive with to-do lists, note templates, and more. NotePad Studio will always feel lightweight, without overwhelming you with too many features at once.

Notepad Studio is currently in early pre-alpha testing/development. Not for production use.
